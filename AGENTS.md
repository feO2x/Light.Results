# Root Agents.md

Light.Results is a lightweight, high-performance library implementing the Result Pattern for .NET. It stands out for reducing allocations and being able to serialize and deserialize results across different protocols (HTTP via RFC-9457, gRPC, Asynchronous Messaging). Extensibility is less important than performance.

## General Rules for the code base

In our Directory.Build.props files in this solution, the following rules are defined:

- Implicit usings or global usings are not allowed - use explicit using statements for clarity.
- Light.Results project is built with .NET Standard 2.0, but you can use C# 14 features.
- All other projects use .NET 10, including the test projects.
- The library is not published yet, you can make breaking changes.
- `<TreatWarningsAsErrors>` is enabled in Release builds, so your code changes must not generate warnings.
- If it is properly encapsulated, make it public. We don't know how callers would like to use this library. When some
  types are internal, this might make it hard for callers to access these in tests or when making configuration changes.
  Prefer public APIs over internal ones.

## Behavioral Guidelines

Tradeoff: These guidelines bias toward caution over speed. For trivial tasks, use judgment.

### 1. Think Before Coding

**Don't assume. Don't hide confusion. Surface tradeoffs.**

Before implementing:

- State your assumptions explicitly. If uncertain, ask.
- If multiple interpretations exist, present them - don't pick silently.
- If a simpler approach exists, say so. Push back when warranted.
- If something is unclear, stop. Name what's confusing. Ask.

### 2. Simplicity First

**Minimum code that solves the problem. Nothing speculative.**

- No features beyond what was asked.
- No abstractions for single-use code.
- No "flexibility" or "configurability" that wasn't requested.
- No error handling for impossible scenarios.
- If you write 200 lines and it could be 50, rewrite it.

Ask yourself: "Would a senior engineer say this is overcomplicated?" If yes, simplify.

### 3. Surgical Changes

**Touch only what you must. Clean up only your own mess.**

When editing existing code:

- Don't "improve" adjacent code, comments, or formatting.
- Don't refactor things that aren't broken.
- Match existing style, even if you'd do it differently.
- If you notice unrelated dead code, mention it - don't delete it.

When your changes create orphans:

- Remove imports/variables/functions that YOUR changes made unused.
- Don't remove pre-existing dead code unless asked.

The test: Every changed line should trace directly to the user's request.

### 4. Goal-Driven Execution

**Define success criteria. Loop until verified.**

Transform tasks into verifiable goals:

- "Add validation" → "Write tests for invalid inputs, then make them pass"
- "Fix the bug" → "Write a test that reproduces it, then make it pass"
- "Refactor X" → "Ensure tests pass before and after"

For multi-step tasks, state a brief plan:

```
1. [Step] → verify: [check]
2. [Step] → verify: [check]
3. [Step] → verify: [check]
```

Strong success criteria let you loop independently. Weak criteria ("make it work") require constant clarification.
